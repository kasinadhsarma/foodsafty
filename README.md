This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.

## Deploying the Backend on Vercel

To deploy the backend Flask application on Vercel, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have the `vercel` CLI installed. If not, install it using npm:

```bash
npm install -g vercel
```

2. Navigate to the root directory of your project and run the following command to link your project to Vercel:

```bash
vercel
```

3. Vercel will detect the `vercel.json` configuration file and deploy the backend as a serverless function.

4. Once the deployment is complete, you will receive a URL where your backend is hosted.

5. Update your frontend application to use the new backend URL for API requests.
